Twilio-based Two Factor Authentication


This project is mostly for demonstration purposes on how you might use Twilio
  with an existing authentication system to create a Two Factor Authentication
  system. Fundamentally it's pretty simple in concept and operation.

No matter what username you put into the initial box, the system will generate
  a one-time use password similar to an RSA token. Once this password is used,
  the user's session is set and the password is destroyed. In this particular
  case, we're not storing anything long term.
